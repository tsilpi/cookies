                    <p>A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–1.5 kg, while larger ones can weigh up to 7–11 kg.
                         All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth.A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. 
                         Puppy refers specifically to young dogs, while pup may be used for other animals such as wolves, seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks.
                         Another interesting fact about puppies is that the number of pups born each day drastically overtakes the number of human babies that come into the world, with approximately 1.2 million pups to 360,000 babies. 
                         That’s roughly 3 times as many puppies as humans! <B>AMAZING!!!</B></p>

            <p align="left">We all love puppies, right? It’s near impossible for any dog lover not to, surely. Wriggly, fluffy, loving and extremely cute – why wouldn’t you love them? Here at Purina we adore the little rascals – and they’re not just adorable; they’re interesting, too. Read on to find out some of our favourite facts about puppies.
                Born without most of their senses fully developed, the first sense that puppies develop is touch. Almost from the very moment they are born, a puppy’s mother will lick and nuzzle them, stimulating their sense of touch. Touch continues to be important for your puppy throughout their lives.
                There are often many puppies in a litter, each genetically unique – but did you know that puppies can be twins? The first confirmed case of this was recorded in South Africa in 2016, with vet Kurt de Cramer delivering them via Caesarean section. Although it’s possible that there have been other unconfirmed cases of genetically identical
                 canine twins, this was the first officially recorded instance of identical puppies being born.
